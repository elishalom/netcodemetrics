# netcodemetrics

This project is a VS extension that computes code complexity as-you-type.

The extension is supported by Visual Studio versions 2012 - 2017.

The complexity being computed is Simple Complexity, as introduced in the Code-Complete book.
The computed complexity reflects how many decision points are in a given function, and the numbers should encourage developers to refactor over-complicated functions.

The extension is listed in VS Gallery: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/369d38e1-53d3-4f5c-9351-a0560162a6d9
